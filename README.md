# PRITI-KUMARI
This Python program checks whether a given word, number, or string is a palindrome. The user inputs a value, and the program reverses it using string manipulation techniques. It then compares the original and reversed strings to determine if they are identical. If they match, the input is classified as a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
